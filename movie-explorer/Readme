# Movie Explorer

## Setup
npm install
npm run dev

## Technical Decisions
- Next.js API routes used as proxy to protect TMDB API key.
- LocalStorage chosen for persistence due to scope and time.
- Local component state used for simplicity.

## Tradeoffs
- No pagination.
- Minimal styling.
- No backend database.

## Improvements with more time
- Pagination / infinite scrolling
- API response caching
- Accessibility improvements
- Server-side favorites persistence
