## 🧠 Notes for Reviewers

This project was intentionally scoped as a working prototype (approximately 3 hours of effort), with emphasis on:

- Clear architecture and separation of concerns
- Practical tradeoffs over over-engineering
- Simple and explainable state management
- Clean, readable code structure

If time allowed, I would explore enhancements such as pagination, server-side persistence, and expanded accessibility support.

I appreciate the opportunity to complete this project and look forward to discussing the implementation choices and tradeoffs during the technical interview.
